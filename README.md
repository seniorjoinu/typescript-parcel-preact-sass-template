# TS + Preact + Sass + Parcel and nothing more
This template provides basic but very powerful boilerplate to start-up your browser app.

### Content
* `Typescript` - type-safe Javascript superset
* `Preact` - better React alternative (google some benchmarks)
* `Sass` - better styling
    1. TS binding to safely import styles into .ts files (see `App.tsx`)
    2. `autoprefixer` and `minifier` are enabled by default
* `Parcel` - much faster webpack alternative

### Usage
* `npm run start` - starts typescript compiler in watch mode and development server with HMR
* `npm run build` - builds app into `dist` folder
